<p>You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Zmodo’s Mobile App is dependent on the third party products and services from which you download the mobile applications, e.g., the App Store from Apple or the Android app market from Google. You acknowledge that these Terms are between you and Zmodo and not with an App Store. Each App Store may have its own terms and conditions to which you must agree before downloading Zmodo’s Mobile App from it. You agree to comply with, and your license to use the Zmodo’s Mobile App is conditioned upon your compliance with, such App Store terms and conditions. To the extent such other terms and conditions from such App Store are less restrictive than, or otherwise conflict with, the terms and conditions of these Terms, the more restrictive or conflicting terms and conditions in these Terms apply.</p>
<p>By using the Services, you expressly relieve and hold harmless Zmodo from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party products and services. Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that Zmodo shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings. If there is a dispute between participants of the Services, or between users and any third party, you understand and agree that Zmodo is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you hereby release Zmodo, its officers, employees, agents, and successors in rights from claims, demands, and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes.</p>
<p>Zmodo hereby disclaims and you hereby discharge, waive and release Zmodo and its licensors and suppliers from any past, present, and future claims, liabilities, and damages, known or unknown, arising out of or relating to your interactions with such third parties and their products and services. YOU HEREBY WAIVE CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE SECTION 1542 IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING, WHICH STATES: “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.” YOU HEREBY WAIVE ANY SIMILAR PROVISION IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.</p>
<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
<p>Please see Zmodo Privacy Policy for information and notices concerning Zmodo’s collection and use of your personal information with respect to the Service. The Privacy Policy is hereby incorporated by reference; your acceptance of this Agreement constitutes your acceptance and agreement to be bound by our Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3>Termination</h3>
<p>This Agreement shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Service. You may terminate your use of the Service at any time. At any time, Zmodo may (i) suspend or terminate your rights to access or use the Services, or (ii) terminate these Terms with respect to you if Zmodo in good faith believes that you have used the Services in violation of these Terms, including any incorporated guidelines, terms or rules. All provisions of this Agreement which, by their nature, should survive termination, shall survive termination, including, without limitation, warranty disclaimers and limitations of liability.</p>
<h3>Disputes Resolution and Arbitration Agreement</h3>
<p>If a dispute arises between you and Zmodo, our goal is to learn about and address your concerns. You agree that you will notify Zmodo about any dispute you have with Zmodo regarding these Terms and Conditions. </p>
<p>For any questions or claims, please <a href="http://www.zmodo.com/Contact/">contact Zmodo.</a></p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">Zmodo may seek injunctive or other equitable relief to protect its confidential information and intellectual property rights or to prevent loss of data or damage to its servers in any court of competent jurisdiction. </p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">Subject this section, you and Zmodo agree that, except for small claims court, any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to Zmodo, including, without limitation, our products, our website, your account(s), promotional offers, user interfaces, our Privacy Policy or our privacy practices generally, these Terms and Conditions, and this Arbitration Agreement, shall be determined by binding arbitration instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. </p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;">Further, you agree that the arbitration is final and binding and subject to only very limited review by a court. You also waive your right to any form of appeal, review or recourse to any court or other judicial authority, insofar as such waiver may be validly made. This provision is intended to be interpreted broadly to encompass all disputes or claims arising out of or relating to your use of the Products. </p>
<p>You must first present any claim or dispute to Zmodo, by certified mail, a written Notice of your claim (“Notice”). The Notice to Zmodo should be addressed to Zmodo Legal Department, 1401 Interstate Dr., Suites B, Champaign, IL, 61822, USA. (“Notice Address”). </p>
<p>If Zmodo elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by certified mail, a written Notice to the address used for your membership account. A Notice, whether sent by you or by Zmodo, must (a) provide name, mailing address and email address of the party, (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, and (c) state the requesting relief. Following receipt of the Notice, we each agree to negotiate with each other in good faith about the claim provided in the Notice. If we do not resolve the claim within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Notice, you or we may commence arbitration. </p>
<p>The arbitration of any dispute or claim shall be conducted in accordance with the then current and applicable rules of the American Arbitration Association as modified by this Agreement. The place of any arbitration will be Alameda County, California, USA, and will be conducted in the English language. Claims will be heard by a single arbitrator. The arbitrator may not award relief in excess of or contrary to what this Agreement provides, order consolidation or arbitration on a class wide or representative basis, award punitive or consequential damages or any other damages aside from the prevailing party’s actual damages, or order injunctive or declaratory relief, except that the arbitrator may award on an individual basis damages required by statute and may order injunctive or declaratory relief pursuant to an applicable consumer protection statute. </p>
<p>Any arbitration shall be confidential, and neither you nor Zmodo nor the arbitrator may disclose the existence, content or results of any arbitration, except as may be required by law or for purposes of enforcement or appeal of the arbitration award. Judgment on any arbitration award may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction. If any portion of this arbitration clause is determined by a court to be inapplicable or invalid, then the remainder shall still be given full force and effect.</p>
<p>There shall be no right or authority for any claims subject to this arbitration clause to be arbitrated on a class action or consolidated basis or on bases involving claims brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public (including, but not limited to, as a private attorney general).</p>
<p>All administrative fees and expenses of arbitration will be divided equally between you and Zmodo. Each party will bear the expense of its own counsel, experts, witnesses and preparation and presentation of evidence at the arbitration hearing.</p>
<p>THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE SHALL SURVIVE TERMINATION OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS. </p>
<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>Zmodo reserves the right to make changes to these Terms. We'll post notice of modifications to these Terms on this page. You should ensure that you have read and agree with our most recent Terms when you use the Services. Continued use of the Services following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgment of such changes and agreement to be bound by the revised Terms.</p>
<p>If any part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion will be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect.</p>
<p>You may not assign or transfer this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, without Zmodo’s prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer this Agreement, without such consent, will be null and of no effect. Zmodo may assign or transfer this Agreement, at its sole discretion, without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
<p>All matters relating to Services and these Terms and any dispute or claim arising therefrom or related thereto (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims), shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of California without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of California or any other jurisdiction). You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in or for Alameda County, California for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes, unless such claim or dispute is required to be arbitrated as set forth in an above section.</p>
<p>Failure or delay by Zmodo to enforce any these Terms will not constitute a waiver of our rights against you and does not affect our right to require future performance thereof.</p>
